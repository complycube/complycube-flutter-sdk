**Native & intuitive UI**: We provide mobile-native screens that guide your customers in capturing their selfies, video recordings, government-issued IDs (such as passports, driving licenses, and residence permits), and proof of address documents (bank statements and utility bills)

**Liveness**: Our market-leading liveness detection provides accurate and extremely fast presence detection on your customers' selfies (3D Passive and Active) and documents to prevent fraud and protect your business. It detects and deters several spoofing vectors, including **printed photo attacks**, **printed mask attacks**, **video replay attacks**, and **3D mask attacks**.

**Auto-capture**: Our UI screens attempt to auto-capture your customer's documents and selfies and run quality checks to ensure that only legible captures are processed by our authentication service.

**Branding & customization**: You can customize the experience by adding your brand colors and text. Furthermore, screens can be added and removed.

**ComplyCube API**: Our [REST API](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference) can be used to build entirely custom flows on top of this native mobile UI layer. We offer backend SDK libraries ([Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@complycube/api), [PHP](https://github.com/complycube/complycube-php), [Python](https://pypi.org/project/complycube/), and [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Complycube/)) to facilitate custom integrations.

**Localized**: We offer multiple localization options to fit your customer needs.

**Secure**: Our GPDR, CCPA, and ISO-certified platform ensure secure and data privacy-compliant end-to-end capture.

## Requirements

- [iOS requirements](https://github.com/complycube/complycube-ios-sdk#requirements)
- [Android requirements](https://github.com/complycube/complycube-android-sdk#requirements)

## Getting Started

### 1. Installing the SDK

#### Flutter package

Install the ComplyCube Flutter package by adding it to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  complycube: 
    hosted: 'https://complycuberepo.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pub/cc-pub-dev-local/'
    version: ^0.0.1
```
Next, add your token from [jFrog](https://complycuberepo.jfrog.io/ui/repos/tree/General/cc-pub-release-local) to gain access to the artifactory repository. This can be done with the following command:

```bash
dart pub token add "https://complycuberepo.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pub/cc-pub-release-local"
```
and
```bash
dart pub get
```

#### CocoaPods

1. Before using the ComplyCube SDK, install the Cocoapods Artifactory plugin by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   gem install cocoapods-art
   ```

2. To add the library, copy your repository credentials into a `.netrc` file to your home directory and setup the repository:

   ```bash
   pod repo-art add cc-cocoapods-release-local "https://complycuberepo.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/pods/cc-cocoapods-release-local"
   ```

3. Add plugin repos by adding the snippet below to the top of your `ios/PodFile` and install the pod using the `pod install` command.

   ```ruby
   plugin 'cocoapods-art', :sources => [
     'cc-cocoapods-release-local',
     'trunk'
   ]
   ...

   platform :ios, '13.0' # Or above

   target 'YourApp' do
       ...
       pod 'ComplyCube'
       ...
   end
   ```

#### Application permissions

##### iOS

Our SDK uses the device camera and microphone for capture. You must add the following keys to your application `Info.plist` file.

- `NSCameraUsageDescription`

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to capture facials biometrics and documents</string>
```

- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription`

```xml
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to capture video biometrics</string>
```

##### Android

Start by adding your access credentials for the ComplyCube SDK repository to the `gradle.properties` file of your **mobile app**:

```gradle
artifactory_user= "USERNAME"
artifactory_password= "ENCRYPTED PASS"
artifactory_contextUrl= https://complycuberepo.jfrog.io/artifactory
```

Then update your application `build.gradle` file with the ComplyCube SDK repository maven settings and SDK dependency:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ...
    repositories {
        ...
        artifactory {
            contextUrl = "${artifactory_contextUrl}"  
            resolve {
                repository {
                    repoKey = 'cc-gradle-release-local'
                    username = "${artifactory_user}"
                    password = "${artifactory_password}"
                    maven = true
                }
            }
        }
    }
    dependencies {
        ....
        //Check for the latest version here: http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.jfrog.artifactory
        classpath "org.jfrog.buildinfo:build-info-extractor-gradle:4+"
        implementation "com.complycube:sdk:+"
    }
}

plugins {
    ...
    id "com.jfrog.artifactory"
}
```

The you can add the following line to disable the header shown on ComplyCube SDK Widget on `styles.xml`:

```xml
...
<style name="LaunchTheme" parent="@android:style/Theme.Light.NoTitleBar">
  ...
  <item name="windowActionBar">false</item>
  <item name="windowNoTitle">true</item>
  ...
</style>
...
```

### 2. Creating a client

Before launching the SDK, your app must first [create a client](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference/clients/create-a-client) using the ComplyCube API.

A client represents the individual on whom you need to perform identity verification checks on. A client is required to generate an SDK token.

This must be done on your **mobile app backend** server.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.complycube.com/v1/clients \
     -H 'Authorization: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{  "type": "person",
            "email": "john.doe@example.com",
            "personDetails":{
                "firstName": "Jane",
                "lastName" :"Doe"
            }
         }'
```

#### Example response

The response will contain an id (the Client ID). It is required for the next step.

```json
{
    "id": "5eb04fcd0f3e360008035eb1",
    "type": "person",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "personDetails": {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
    },
    "createdAt": "2023-01-01T17:24:29.146Z",
    "updatedAt": "2023-01-01T17:24:29.146Z"
}
```

### 3. Creating an SDK token

**SDK Tokens** enable clients to securely send personal data from your **mobile app** to ComplyCube.
[To learn more about our SDK Token endpoint](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference/other-resources/tokens).

> You must generate a new token each time you initialize the ComplyCube Web SDK.

#### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.complycube.com/v1/tokens \
     -H 'Authorization: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
           "clientId":"CLIENT_ID",
           "appId": "com.complycube.SampleApp"
         }'
```

#### Example response

```json
{
    "token": "<CLIENT_TOKEN>"
}
```

### 4. Prepare the SDK stages

Initialize the `stages` in a `settings` object with the stages you wish to include so that it can be used in the Flutter component.

```dart
import 'package:complycube_flutter/ComplyCubeMobileSDK.dart';

final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
      {
        "name": 'intro',
        "heading": 'Green Bank ID verification',
      },
      {
        "name": 'documentCapture',
        "showGuidance": false,
        "useMLAssistance": true,
        "retryLimit": 1,
        "documentTypes": {
          "passport": true,
          "driving_license": ['GB', 'FR'],
        },
      },
      'faceCapture',
  ],
  ...
}
```

### 5. Initialize the Flutter Widget

Initialize the `settings` object by setting the SDK token, client ID, and the stages of the flow.

```dart
final settings = {
  "clientID": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "clientToken": "<CLIENT_TOKEN>",
  "stages": [...],
  ...
}
```

You can now incorporate the ComplyCube Flutter widget into your screen.

```dart
return MaterialApp(
  home: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      title: Text('ComplyCube Integration'),
    ),
    body: ComplyCubeWidget(settings: settings),
  ),
);
```

### 6. Perform checks

Using the results returned in the `onSuccess` callback, you can trigger your mobile backend to run the necessary checks on your client.

For example, use the result of a selfie and document capture as follows:

- `result.documentId` to run a [Document Check](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference/check-types/document-check)

- `result.documentId` and `result.livePhotoId` to run an [Identity Check](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference/check-types/identity-check)

#### Example response

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.complycube.com/v1/checks \
     -H 'Authorization: <YOUR_API_KEY>' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{
            "clientId":"CLIENT_ID",
            "type": "document_check",
            "documentId":"DOCUMENT_ID"
         }'
```

### 7. Setup webhooks and retrieve results

Our checks are asynchronous, and all results and event notifications are done via webhooks.

Follow our [webhook guide](https://docs.complycube.com/documentation/guides/webhooks) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

Your mobile backend can retrieve all check results using our API.

## 4. Customization

### Stages

Each stage in the flow can be customized to create the ideal journey for your clients. Every stage must be in the stages array in the settings object.

Stages can be a string or an object that contains the stage’s customizations.

#### Welcome stage

This is the first screen of the flow. It displays a welcome message and a summary of the stages you have configured for the client. If you would like to use a custom title and message, you can set them as follows:

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
    {
        "name": 'intro',
        "heading": 'My Company Verification',
        "message": 'We will now verify your identity so you can start trading.',
      },
      ...
  ]
  ...
}
```

The welcome stage will always default to show as the first screen.

#### Consent stage

You can optionally add this stage to enforce explicit consent collection before the client can progress in the flow. The consent screen allows you to set a custom title and the consenting body.

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
    {
        "name": 'consent',
        "heading": 'Terms of Service',
        "message": 'At My company, we are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our users. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect...',
      },
      ...
  ]
  ...
}
```

#### Document stage

This stage allows clients to select the type of identity document they would like to submit. You can customize these screens to:

- Limit the scope of document types the client can select, e.g., Passport only.
- Set the document issuing countries they are allowed for each document type.
- Add or remove automated capture using smart assistance.
- Show or hide the instruction screens before capture.
- Set a retry limit to allow clients to progress the journey regardless of capture quality.

> If you provide only one document type, the document type selection screen will be skipped. The country selection screen will be skipped if you provide only a single country for a given document type.

You can remove the information screens shown before camera captures by enabling or disabling guidance. You should only consider omitting this if you have clearly informed your customer of the capture steps required.

> :warning: Please note the retryLimit you set here will take precedence over the retry limit that has been set globally in the [developer console](https://portal.complycube.com/automations).

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
    ...
   {
        "name": 'documentCapture',
        "showGuidance": false,
        "useMLAssistance": true,
        "retryLimit": 1,
        "liveCapture": false,
        "documentTypes": {
          "passport": true,
          "driving_license": ['GB', 'US'],
        },
      },
      ...
  ]
  ...
}
```

#### Selfie photo and video stage

You can request a selfie photo ([live photo](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference/live-photos)) capture or video ([live video](https://docs.complycube.com/api-reference/live-videos)) capture from your customer.

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
    ...
   {
        "name": 'faceCapture',
        "mode": 'photo', // Or video
        "useMLAssistance": false
    },
      ...
  ]
  ...
}
```

#### Proof of address stage

When requesting a proof of address document, you can set the allowed document type and whether the client can upload the document. When liveCapture is set to false, the client will be forced to perform a live capture.

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
    ...
   {
        "name": 'poaCapture',
        "liveCapture": false
    },
      ...
  ]
  ...
}
```

### Look and feel

The SDK allows you to set colors to match your existing application or brand. You can customize the colors by setting the relevant values when building your flow.

```dart
final settings = {
  "lookAndFeel": {
    "colors": {
      "primaryButtonBgColor": '#FFFFFF',
    },
    "uiInterfaceStyle": "dark",
    "buttonRadius": 10,
  }
}
```

Available properties for color customization:

| Property                       | Description                                     |

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available properties for `uiInterfaceStyle` customization:

| Property                       | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| inherit                        | Inherit actual device (default)                 |
| light                          | Light theme                                     |
| dark                           | Dark theme                                      |

### Localization

To specify the language, configure the `language` property within the `settings` object:

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "language": ["fr"]
}
```

The SDK provides the following language support:

- Arabic - `ar` :united_arab_emirates:
- Dutch - `nl` :netherlands:
- English - `en` :uk:
- French - `fr` :fr:
- German - `de` :de:
- Hindi - `hi` :india:
- Italian - `it` :it:
- Norwegian - `no` :norway:
- Polish - `po` :poland:
- Portuguese - `pt` :portugal:
- Spanish - `es` :es:
- Swedish - `sv` :sweden:
- Chinese (Simplified) - `zh` :cn:

## Result handling

To handle result callbacks, you can use the `onSuccess`, `onCancelled`, and `onError` functions provided by the ComplyCube Flutter widget:

```dart
void onSuccess(Map<String, dynamic> results) {
  final documentId = results["documentIds"][0];
  final selfieId = results["livePhotoIds"][0];

  // Send the IDs to your server to perform checks
  sendToServer(documentId, selfieId);
}

...

ComplyCubeWidget(
  settings: settings,
  onSuccess: onSuccess,
  onCancelled: onCancelled,
  onError: onError,
),
```

Upon an `onSuccess` callback, you can create check requests using the captured data. The IDs of the uploaded resources are returned in the `results` parameter, which is a Dart Map.

For example, our default flow, which includes an Identity Document, a Selfie (Live Photo), and Proof of Address, would have a `results` parameter with `"documentIds": ["xxxxx"]`, `"livePhotoIds": ["xxxxx"]`, "liveVideoIds": ["xxxxxx"] and `"poaIds": ["xxxxxx"]`.

## Error handling

If the SDK experiences issues, a `ComplyCubeError` and `ComplyCubeErrorCode` objects are returned with a string description and error code, respectively.

You can implement error handling as follows:

```dart
void onCancelled(ComplyCubeError error) {
  switch (error.code) {
    case ComplyCubeErrorCode.NoConsentGiven:
      print("The user did not provide their consent")
      break;
    case ComplyCubeErrorCode.UserExited:
      print("The user exited the verification flow")
      break;
  }
}


void onError(ComplyCubeError error) {
    // Managing errors based on code
  switch (error.code) {
    case ComplyCubeErrorCode.DeletedResource:
      print("The resource has been deleted")
      break;
    case ComplianceErrorCode.LimitRate:
        print("The rate limit has been reached")
      break;
    // Add more cases for other error codes
    default:
      print("An error has occurred")
  }
}
```

The SDK can return the following error codes:

| Error code | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.NotAuthorized``` | The SDK has attempted a request to an endpoint you are not authorized to use.|
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.ExpiredToken``` | The token used to initialize the SDK has expired. Create a new SDK token and restart the flow. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.DocumentMandatory``` | A **Document stage** is mandatory with the currently configured stages. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.JailBroken``` | The SDK cannot be launched on this device as it has been compromised. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.NoDocumentTypes``` | A **Document stage** has been initialized without setting document types. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.BiometricStageCount``` | The configuration provided contains duplicate **Selfie photo** or **Selfie video** stages. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.UploadError``` | An error occurred during the upload document or selfie upload process. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.InvalidCountryCode``` | An invalid country code is provided. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.UnsupportedCountryTypeCombination``` | An unsupported country code is provided for a specific document type. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.FlowError``` | An unrecoverable error occurred during the flow. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.MissingToken``` | Attempted to launch the SDK without setting the SDK token. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.DuplicateStages``` | Launch configuration contains duplicate stages. |
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.UploadRequireGuidance``` | If `liveCapture` is set to `false`, enabling the guidance feature is required. This can be done by setting `isGuidanceEnabled` to `true`.|
| ```ComplyCubeErrorCode.Unknown``` | An unexpected error has occurred. If this keeps occurring, let us know about it. |

## Custom event handler

If you want to implement your own user tracking, the SDK enables you to insert your custom tracking code for the [tracked events](#events-tracking).

To incorporate your own tracking, define a function and apply it using the `onCustomEvent` property when initializing the ComplyCube Flutter widget:

```dart
// onCustomEvent with event that contains event name
void onCustomEvent(ComplyCubeCustomEvent event){
  switch(event.name){
    case 'BIOMETRICS_STAGE_SELFIE_CAMERA':
      print("The client reached capture camera for a selfie")
      break;
  }
}


ComplyCubeWidget(
  settings: settings,
  ...
  onCustomEvent: onCustomEvent,
  ...
),
```

## Token expiry Handler

If you want to automatically manage token expiration, you can use a callback function to generate a new token and seamlessly continue the process with it.

```dart
String onTokenExpiry(String token){
  // Insert custom token renewal code here
  String new_token = "New token value";
  return new_token;
}

ComplyCubeWidget(
  settings: settings,
  ...
  onTokenExpiry: onTokenExpiry,
  ...
),
```

## NFC capture

- [iOS requirements](https://github.com/complycube/complycube-ios-sdk#pre-requisites)

With the ComplyCube SDK, you can read NFC-enabled identity documents and confirm their authenticity and identity.

To perform an NFC read, you'll first have to scan the document to obtain the necessary key for accessing the chip.

> :information_source: Please get in touch with your **Account Manager** or **[support](https://support.complycube.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new)** to get access to our NFC Enabled Mobile SDK.

The SDK supports the following features

- Basic access control
- Secure messaging
- Passive Authentication
- Active authentication
- Chip authentication

The **NFC stage** can only be initialized following a **Document stage**, otherwise you will encounter a `ComplyCubeErrorCode.DocumentMandatory` error.

```dart
final settings = {
  ...
  "stages": [
    ...
    {
      "name": 'documentCapture',
      "showGuidance": false,
      "useMLAssistance": true,
      "retryLimit": 1,
      "liveCapture": false,
      "documentTypes": {
        "passport": true,
        "driving_license": ['GB', 'US'],
      },
      // Add this property to enable NFC
      "nfcCapture": true
    },
    ...
  ]
  ...
};
```
